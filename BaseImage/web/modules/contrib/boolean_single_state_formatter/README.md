# Boolean Single State Formatter

## Introduction

This module provides an additional formatter to Boolean field, that provides display for only one state (on by default).

According to the value of the boolean field, the formatter may hide the output of the field. This is useful when you
want to only have some text when the state is "on" and nothing displayed when "off".
